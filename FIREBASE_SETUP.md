# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your Firebase authentication system is now implemented! Here's what you need to do to get it working:

## 1. Firebase Console Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable Authentication:
   - Go to "Authentication" → "Sign-in method"
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
4. Get your Firebase config:
   - Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
   - Scroll down to "Your apps"
   - Click "Add app" → Web app
   - Copy the config object

## 2. Update Firebase Configuration

Replace the placeholder values in `/config/firebase.ts` with your actual Firebase config:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-actual-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-actual-app-id"
};
```

## 3. Test the Authentication

1. Run your app: `npm start`
2. You should see the login screen
3. Create a new account using the "Sign Up" option
4. Sign in with your credentials
5. You'll be redirected to the main app
6. Use the logout button (📤) in the header to sign out

## 🔧 Features Implemented

- ✅ Email/Password authentication
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ User login
- ✅ User logout
- ✅ Authentication state management
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Form validation

## 📱 User Flow

1. **Unauthenticated users** see the login/signup screen
2. **New users** can create an account
3. **Existing users** can sign in
4. **Authenticated users** see the main app
5. **Users can sign out** using the logout button

## 🛠️ File Structure

```
├── config/
│   └── firebase.ts          # Firebase configuration
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.tsx      # Authentication context
├── screens/
│   ├── AuthScreen.tsx       # Auth container
│   ├── LoginScreen.tsx      # Login form
│   ├── SignUpScreen.tsx     # Signup form
│   └── HomeScreen.tsx       # Main app (updated with logout)
└── App.tsx                  # Main app with auth provider
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords are handled securely by Firebase
- User sessions are managed automatically
- Authentication state persists across app restarts
- All authentication is handled server-side by Firebase

## 🎨 UI Features

- Clean, modern authentication screens
- Form validation with user feedback
- Loading states during authentication
- Error handling with alerts
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## 🚀 Next Steps

You can extend this authentication system by adding:
- Password reset functionality
- Social authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Email verification
- User profile management
- Remember me functionality

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your Firebase config is correct
2. Ensure Authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
3. Verify your project has the correct permissions
4. Check the console for any error messages

Happy coding! 🎉
